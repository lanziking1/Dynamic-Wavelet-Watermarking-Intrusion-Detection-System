# Dynamic-Wavelet-Watermarking-Intrusion-Detection-System
Dynamic Wavelet Watermarking Intrusion Detection System (DWW-IDS) for CAN bus security. This repository contains the open-source implementation of our proposed method, including data preprocessing method, dynamic wavelet watermarking algorithms, and the trend-season decomposition-based neural network model.
